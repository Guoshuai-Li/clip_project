# CLIP Image-Text Retrieval with Prompt Engineering

## Overview
This project implements an **image-text retrieval system** using [OpenAI's CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip) model, evaluated on the Flickr30k dataset.  
It includes:
- Basic image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval
- Evaluation metrics (Top-1 Accuracy, Recall@k)
- Prompt Engineering experiments to explore the effect of different text templates
- Visualization of retrieval performance across prompts
